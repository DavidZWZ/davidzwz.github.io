Hi! Glad to meet you here. :wave: Currently, I am pursuing my Computer Science Ph.D degree in [BDSC lab](https://bdsc-uic.github.io/people.html) under the supervision of Prof. [Philip S. Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D0lL1r0AAAAJ) at [University of Illinois Chicago](https://www.uic.edu/). I am also working as a Research Scientist Intern at <span style="color: #0866FF"><i class="fab fa-meta"></i> Meta</span>. Previously, I was an Applied Scientist Intern at <span style="color:rgb(239, 156, 32)"><i class="fab fa-amazon"></i> Amazon</span>, and I accomplished my bachelor degree at [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) and [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2022. My research interests includes <span style="color:rgb(128, 28, 0)">**personalization**</span>, <span style="color:rgb(128, 28, 0)">**recommendation**</span>, <span style="color:rgb(128, 28, 0)">**large language models**</span>, and <span style="color:rgb(128, 28, 0)">**agents**</span>. 

Outside of research, I'm an outdoor enthusiast who loves hiking :hiking_boot:, road trips :red_car:, and skiing :ski:. I'm currently learning tennis :tennis: and always excited to pick up new sports. As an ENFJ, I enjoy connecting with people - feel free to reach out for an in-person chat or outdoor activities! :mountain: :camping: 

:blush: Feel free to drop me an email for any form of communication or collaboration! :handshake:

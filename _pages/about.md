Hi! Glad to meet you here. :wave: Currently, I am pursuing my Computer Science Ph.D degree under the supervision of Prof. [Philip S. Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D0lL1r0AAAAJ) in [BDSC lab](https://bdsc-uic.github.io/people.html) at [University of Illinois Chicago](https://www.uic.edu/). I am also working as a Research Scientist Intern at <span style="color: #0866FF"><i class="fab fa-meta"></i> Meta</span>.

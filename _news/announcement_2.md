:tada::tada::tada: One paper [LightGODE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18910) has been accepted in [CIKM 2024](https://cikm2024.org/). In this work, we challenge the necessity of graph convolution in the recommender systems and propose LightGODE for extremely efficient and large-scale graph recommendation. Welcome to check :eyes: our [released code](https://github.com/DavidZWZ/LightGODE).
